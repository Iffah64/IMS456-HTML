                            <h3>Tadika Arifmurni Durian Tunggal, Melaka</h3>
                            <p>After I finished my high school, I started working while waiting for my
                                <br>SPM results at Tadika Arifmurni Durian Tunggal for 3 months. There
                                <br>I learned various things in terms of responsibility, friendship and
                                <br>difficulties in finding money. Not forgetting the very valuable
                                <br>experience I got while working there. I have considered them like
                                <br>sisters because they have taught me a lot about life and also they
                                <br>treat me like their own sisters. Even though we only knew each other
                                <br>for a short period of time, they never forgot about me and sometimes
                                <br>asked how I was doing and never forgot that I never forgot to rebuke them.</p>

                            <h3>Library of SK Bukit Beruang</h3>
                            <p>After I took my diploma at UiTM Rembau, I continued my studies for my
                                <br>degree in Library Management. The picture above is me with the
                                <br>teacher who manages the library as well as the library supervisor
                                <br>at the school. Here I can learn various things about the library
                                <br>and I am currently just helping the teacher who is a friend of
                                <br>my mother. I really enjoyed this experience and I was also able
                                <br>to recall my memories at that school since it was my primary
                                <br>school. I was able to find out how to catalog books, organize
                                <br>books according to the call number that has been made and also
                                <br>according to its own section.</p>
