						<h2>Sekolah Kebangsaan Gangsa</h2>
						<p>When I was 7 years old, from grade 1 to grade 3, I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Bangsa together with my two older sisters. I really like going to school here because I can be with my sister and I have a guardian when I'm at school. Every meal I eat and drink at this school is taken care of by my sister who is very concerned about me and whenever I need her, they will be with me until I am well.</p>

						<h2>Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Beruang</h2>
						<p>When I was 9 years old, I had to change schools because both of my sisters had already finished primary school and started going up to secondary school and I was the only one still in primary school. I moved to Bukit Beruang National School where my mother worked as a teacher there.</p>

						<h2>Sekolah Menengah Arab (JAIM) Al-Asyraf</h2>
						<p>After I finished my studies in primary school, I started my boarding school at Sekolah Menengah Arab (JAIM) Al-Asyraf in Pulau Sebang, Alor Gajah, Melaka. At that school, I didn't know a single person and they were all new people and here I met and got to know many new people. The school gave its students a choice whether to sit in the dormitory or not and I was told to sit in the dormitory because the distance between the school and my house was far and I agreed because I didn't want to trouble my father and mother to send me every morning. I attended school there from the age of 13 until I finished my studies in 2018 when I was 17 years old.</p>

						<h2>UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan Kampus Rembau</h2>
						<p>After finishing SPM, I was able to continue my studies for a diploma in the field of information management for 2 and a half years. However, after entering the second semester, we were told to go home to each other because the news said that Malaysia will implement the MCO which is the Movement Control Order and all students regardless of IPTA, IPTS or school students or even workers are prohibited from leaving the house unless there is business only important Therefore, I ran my classes online for 2 years and finished my diploma in 2022, February and extended my degree in month 3 of 2023 and now it's my second year in semester 5.</p>
