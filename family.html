                Hi guys, so here's my family picture. I've got 2 sister, one brother and one younger sister. My father's name is Mohd Nizam bin Omar and he is 55 years old. He born on 26 June 1968 at Johor Bharu. My mother's name is Nor Jana'ah @ Nor Jannah binti Abdul Wahab. She was born at Kuala Terengganu on 17 February 1970. She is 53 years old this year and both of my parents work as teacher but for my dad, he's already retired on 1st August 2022. I called them as Ayah and Ibu and Ibu still work as teacher at SK Bukit Beruang.
            </h5>

            <h5>
                Now let me talk about my siblings which include me, I've 5 siblings. The first child of this family name as Syifa' Nur Aqilah, 27 years old and now working at SRA (JAIM) Taman Datuk Tamby Chik Karim. Next is my second sister which her name is Ulfah 'Izz Zahin, 25 years old and currently working at Intel Technology Sdn. Bhd. at Pulau Pinang. Then, my younger brother's name Ammar Danish, 17 years old and studying at SMK Ayer Keroh, Melaka. He was the only one boy in our family besides Ayah. They were born at Kuala Terengganu and it was different for my youngest sister which she was born at Melaka. Her name was Anis Afrina Ishaireen, 15 years old and studying at the same school as Ammar which is SMK Ayer Keroh, Melaka.
            </h5>
            <br>
			<br>
            <h5>
                Our routine always start at 6 am which is wake up to get ready for school and work. Ayah will stanby at the car to send Ibu, Ammar and Anis to school while Kakak will stay at home in the morning and start her work in the evening which is 2pm. As for my sister which I call her Adik, she's staying at Pulau Pinang because her office was at Pulau Pinang. She used to tell me that she will start working at 8 am so he will drive herself to the office at 7.30 am because her office was close with her place. As for weekend, Ayah will buy wet ingredients for the kitchen such as chicken, fish, or anything frozen food. Sometimes, Ayah also will take us for a walk which sometimes goes to the beach, sometimes back to the village or even take us out to eat and it was so much fun hehe.
